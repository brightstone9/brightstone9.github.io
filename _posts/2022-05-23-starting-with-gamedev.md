### **Are you a gamer?** 

My parents didn't really approve of playing video games. I didn't have much option in games, choices being limited to free pc games. I spent hours and hours going through sites like Kongregate, New Grounds and Armor games. I spent night after night playing Kingdom of the Winds and Maple Story *(MMORPGs that was popular in Korea)*.

I bought my first video game when I was 20 and I held a controller for the first time when I was 22. I didn't know what Halo was nor did I know who Jill Valentine was until I was 21. I still haven't played many of the big titles. But still, when someone asks, I say *"Yes. I like playing games"*.

### **What kind of games do I like?**
#### *Quantic Gamer Type*

I love playing games. I play games almost every single day and my ideal weekend is on the sofa, with laptop or a controller in my hand. But what kind of games do I like? I like playing games alone, but I won't say no to an online game. I like sandbox/simulation games, but it's not that I like everything from that genre.

While watching videos from GDCs, I came across the [Gamer Motivation Profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/answer/gamerprofile/) test. After answering a couple of questions, it shows what kind of a gamer you are. Intrigued, I decided to invest 5 min of my time.

According to the test I am a type 'Architect'. *" **Architects** are solo gamers that enjoy planning, decision-making, and progression. They prefer slow-paced, relaxing gameplay where they can plan and build something grand and enduring."* Well, that makes sense I guess.

I enjoy a good community. I like improving my charater, not necessary to compete with others, but just for the sake of it. I don't need a well written story, but need a world, where I can pretend to be in. 

### **Why do I want to make games?**

Sadly, there wasn't much game that really spoke to me. Yes, there are games that I absolutely love and still am spending hundreds of hours playing. But I needed something new.

So I decided that I wanted to make something that I would enjoy playing. Something that fits every single criteria that I have for a perfect game. 

Being a computer science major, I was also interested in making something that will be mine (I know it sounds creepy and strange). I know that I can't do this all on my own, but I just wanted something to be mine. 

At work, I have to do what the others want. What I do is for the company and I am nothing but a small part in the big picture. I want to make something. Something that I can look back in the future and say is mine. 

So begins my slow journey in making games. I have never made anything so this would be a slow process, but I will try to stick to it.
